AnimalLookup is a boilerplate for looking up FDX/HDX-RFID-chips embedded in animals and then looking up the ID of that animal in a country-specific database. 

Included in the boilerplate is support for a TTY-hooked device that outputs IDs once an animals proximity powers the chip. Also included is the Norwegian database. So this boilerplate should work without any changes when using similar equipment in Norway. You might want to change most of this depending on your equipment and country of operation.

This code is for experimental and educational purposes and should be considered under an MIT-license.
