# This is a boilerplate for looking up animals by looking at embedded RFID-tags and 
# matching those with online databases. This example uses a FDX/HDX-reader that connects
# to the machine as a TTY-device. The behaviour of the reader is to output version number
# of the firmware when polled with a "VER\r\n" and then output the ISO-standard animal ID
# embedded in a proximal, compatible RFID-tag when said tag is powered by the inductor.
# You might want to change the reader-specific code a bit depending on your device, but
# the principals remain the same. You also might want to find a country-specific database
# for looking up animals. In this example I have included the Norwegian database.
# This code is for educational purposes and should not be considered production worthy as it is
# not tested at all. Consider this released under an MIT-license.
